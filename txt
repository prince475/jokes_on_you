1. What does the `.map()` array method do?
# It maps our through our data(array) and returns a new array that we want in the same index.
# .map() method takes a function as its parameter
# Returns a new array. Whatever gets returned from the call back function
# provided is placed at the same index in the new array.
# usually we take the items from the original array and modify them in some way.


2. What do we usually use `.map` for in React?
# To get the data we need for our app from a an array or an object beacuse usually most data is inform of objects
# Helps us convert an array of raw data into an array of jsx elemants that can be displayed on the page

3. Why is using `.map()` better than just creating the components
manually by typing them out?
# creating components manually is kinda dry, take for instance in an e-commerce website, if a customer purchases an item.
# It makes sense to have a sytem that automatically updates the list of items by itself by just inputing data other than updating each simngle item manually.
# Makes our code more cleaner and reusable/ more "self-sustaining" - not requirring additional changes whenever the data changes.
